 👋🏽 Welcome to my Newsletter (+ free gift inside 🎁 )
First off, I want to say thanks for trusting me with your email address.

I know there are a lot of marketers out there who force you to opt in to their list and then bombard you with crappy emails.

This is not one of those lists and I’ll prove it to you over the next few days...

I’m gonna blow the lid off what actually makes an offer irresistible and how to scale it—and why so many people get it dead wrong.

Most coaches and consultants struggle because they’ve been fed the same tired advice:
​
​❌ "Just post more content!"
❌ "Charge your worth!"
❌ "You’re just one funnel away!"

Nah. That’s a lie.

If you stay plugged in, here’s what you’re gonna walk away with:

    How to craft an offer so good, people feel silly saying no. (Even if you don’t have a big audience)
    Why stacking bonuses and “adding more value” is the fastest way to kill your sales.
    How one of my clients went from getting fired to $102K in 74 days with a single Offer Doc.
    The exact process I use to create, validate, and scale high-ticket offers—without sales calls or fancy funnels.

So yeah… you’re about to get heat from your new BFF. 🔥
Why listen to me?

I’ve spent the last decade helping coaches, creators, and consultants turn their knowledge into predictable income.

    I built the digital strategy that took an unknown startup to $100M in two years.
    I’ve helped experts like Jon Acuff, Carey Nieuwhof, Sean Cannell, and Christine Caine scale their offers.
    I’ve personally spent over $7M on ads and tested just about every offer framework under the sun.

Most people teaching this stuff are just repackaging theory.
I’m giving you what actually works.

IMPORTANT:

Because I love rewarding action takers… for the next few days only, you can grab my Banger Offers That Sell course for just $297 (normally $2,000).

This is the exact system my clients use to create six- and seven-figure offers without wasting months on content or funnels.

After these "Welcome Emails," you can buy it, but it will cost $2,000.

#3 Subject: how I made 126K while my wife was in surgery

Most people spend months trying to build the perfect offer.
​
They tweak their pricing…
They add more bonuses…
They spend weeks building a fancy funnel…
And then? Crickets.

It’s not their fault.

They’re following what every "marketing gooroo" says:

    Build a complex funnel.
    Do endless sales calls.
    Launch a big product before knowing if anyone even wants it.

That’s exactly what I did… until my world flipped upside down.

A few years ago, my wife needed an invasive surgery that could have ended her life.​
I couldn't do any sales calls so I can focus on her.

For almost a month, I didn’t take a single call.
I didn’t launch a funnel.
I didn’t “do outreach.”

👀 But here’s what’s crazy… I still made $126k in sales.

How?

I stripped everything down to the simplest way to sell:

    A Google Doc
    A few emails
    A clear, irresistible offer

That’s it.

Turns out, I didn’t need a fancy funnel. I just needed a BANGER OFFER.

The #1 Reason Most Offers Flop?

Most people try to solve too many problems at once.
Your offer doesn’t need to be a massive program or a high-production course.

It needs to hit one pressing problem your audience has.

    Something so urgent they feel silly saying no.
    Something so simple they know they can act on it.
    Something so clear they trust you can help.

That’s how I went from overcomplicating my business to selling over $100k in a month—without a funnel.

How to Create a Banger Offer That Sells?

I took everything I learned from that moment and turned it into a repeatable system.

    Step 1: Solve ONE urgent problem, not everything at once.
    Step 2: Validate your offer before building a funnel.
    Step 3: Sell it with simple, low-friction systems.

That’s what I teach inside Banger Offers That Sell course.

It’s the exact process my clients use to:

    Land $3k-$10k clients without calls.
    Sell without waiting months to “launch.”
    Finally have an offer that converts consistently.

And if you’re tired of spinning your wheels, I’ll show you how to do it, too.

#4 Subject: he got fired then I helped him make 37k in 6 days (here's how)

Imagine this…

You’ve just had a baby.
Your entire world is shifting.
And the next day—you lose your job.

That’s exactly what happened to Nolan the day after his son was born.

Zero income. A newborn at home. Pressure mounting.

Most people in that situation would scramble to find another job. But Nolan made a different choice.

Instead of looking for another boss, he decided to bet on himself.

That’s when we started working together to create his first offer.

In just 6 days, he made $37K.
In 74 days, he had collected $102K.
And now? He’ll never have to “apply” for a job again.

Here’s What Changed Everything:

    We didn’t build a fancy funnel.
    We didn’t create a complex marketing strategy.
    We did one thing right—his offer.

What Would Happen if You Finally Nailed YOUR Offer?

❌ No more guessing what your audience actually wants.
❌ No more hoping the next tweak magically works.
✅ Instead, you have a clear, compelling offer that sells itself.

And that’s exactly what I help people do inside Banger Offers That Sell.​

It's currently $297 and will jump to the regular price of $2k when this Welcome Series is over.

It's the same process I took Nolan through.

Talk soon,
Alejandro “Come Thru Friend of the Year” Reyes

PS: Nolan could have played it safe. Gone back to another job. Stayed stuck.

Instead, he created a Banger Offer that changed everything.

#5 Subject: this one mistake is silently killing your sales

A lot of people believe the key to creating a successful offer is packing in as much value as possible.

More bonuses.
More content.
More features.

But here’s the truth…

More doesn’t mean better—it means overwhelming.

And when you overwhelm people, they don’t buy.
They hesitate.
They think, “This sounds great, but I don’t have time for all that right now.”

That’s why so many offers get ignored, while others sell like crazy.
The Best-Selling Offers Aren’t the Biggest—They’re the Simplest

Instead of solving everything, the best offers solve one urgent, high-stakes problem.

The kind of problem that makes someone stop scrolling, pull out their wallet, and say, “I NEED this.”

Marketing legend Dan Kennedy calls it the “bleeding neck” problem.

If your audience has a minor headache, they’ll deal with it.
But if they’re bleeding out, they’ll do anything to stop it—right now.

That’s the difference between an offer people “think about”… and an offer they can’t say no to.
How to Fix Your Offer (Right Now)

Step 1: Identify the one problem that’s causing them the most pain.
Step 2: Strip away anything extra that doesn’t help solve that one problem.
Step 3: Make your offer so specific and so urgent that they instantly know it’s for them.

This is exactly what I help my clients do inside Banger Offers That Sell.

We take what’s already inside your head and your heart and package it into an offer that is so clear and compelling that selling it feels effortless.

And right now, because you’re in my Welcome Email Series, you can join for an exclusive, one-time-only price.
The Welcome Series Offer (Disappears Soon!)

Most people spend months tweaking their offers, hoping they “just work.”

But instead of guessing, you can build an offer that’s so good, selling it feels inevitable.

That’s what I help you do inside the Banger Offers That Sell course.

Normally, the course is $2,000, but for this Welcome Series only, you can grab it for just $297.

This offer expires once this welcome sequence ends.
I won’t be sending any reminders.

P.S. – Most People Get This Wrong

Most people think adding more bonuses, modules, and “value” makes their offer stronger.

But the truth? It usually makes it weaker.

#6 Subject: weird “80/20 secret” to creating offers that sell
# bGuru Says

Yesterday, I told you why ‘more’ isn’t always better. But today, I want to show you something even more important…
​
Most people don’t just add too much to their offer—they waste 80% of their time on things that don’t actually drive sales.

    They spend weeks tweaking their pricing...
    They add more bonuses hoping it makes their offer irresistible...
    They build funnels before they even know if their offer works...

And then? Crickets.

If your offer isn’t selling, it’s not because you need more stuff.
​
It’s because you’re focusing on the wrong things.

The 80/20 Rule of Offers​
The 80/20 Principle says 80% of your results come from just 20% of your efforts.

And when it comes to crafting offers that sell, this means:

🔹 20% of your offer (the bleeding neck problem) creates 80% of your sales.
🔹 20% of your messaging (positioning + clarity) makes 80% of the impact.
🔹 20% of your marketing (low-friction sales process) generates 80% of your revenue.

But most people do the opposite—they spend time perfecting things that don’t actually sell the offer.

Here’s the Fix:​
If you want an offer that sells consistently, you need to:

    Focus on solving one urgent, high-stakes problem your audience has.
    Cut out everything extra that doesn’t help them get a quick win.
    Stop overcomplicating the sale—use a simple, low-friction system.

That’s exactly what I teach inside Banger Offers That Sell.

This is how my clients go from guessing and tweaking to getting real sales—without burning months building funnels or running in circles.

If you’re tired of wondering “why isn’t my offer converting?”, let’s fix it.

Check out all the details of the Banger Offers That Sell course here. It's only $297 for a few more days during this welcome series.

The price is only available in this Welcome Series because I love to reward action takers.

Alejandro “Simplicity Sells” Reyes

If your offer isn’t selling, it’s not because you need more bonuses, a lower price, or a fancy funnel. It’s because you’re focusing on the wrong 80%.

The Banger Offers That Sell Course will help you fix that.

#7 Subject: 5 deadly offer mistakes and how to avoid them


Ever poured your soul into an offer, only to hear crickets?

You tweak the price…
Add another bonus…
Maybe even rebuild the whole thing from scratch.

Still? Nothing.

If that sounds familiar, it’s not your fault.
​
Most people make the same mistakes over and over… without even realizing it.

And these 5 offer-killing mistakes are keeping you from getting paid what you're worth:

🚨 Mistake #1: Trying to solve every problem at once

More isn’t better—it’s overwhelming.
A “meh” offer tries to do everything. A Banger Offer focuses on one high-stakes problem your audience is desperate to solve.

🚨 Mistake #2: Building a funnel before testing your offer

Funnels don’t fix bad offers.
Before you waste time on tech, validate your offer with real people—so you’re scaling something that actually works.

🚨 Mistake #3: Pricing too low (because you’re “just starting”)

Low prices don’t make people buy—they make them question your value.
If your offer solves an urgent problem, charge accordingly.

🚨 Mistake #4: Relying on endless sales calls

Sales calls suck up your time and don’t scale.
With the right offer and positioning, people should be pre-sold before they even reach out.

🚨 Mistake #5: Posting content with no clear conversion strategy

Just posting on social media won’t get you sales.
Your content should lead people straight to your offer—not just “build engagement.”

Want to Fix These Mistakes (And Start Selling Now)?

If any of these mistakes sound familiar, we need to fix them before you waste more time.

That’s exactly what I help people do inside Banger Offers That Sell course.

Normally, this course is $2,000, but because you're in my Welcome Series and I love rewarding action takers, you can grab it for just $297—but only for a couple more days.

I noticed you haven’t gotten my Banger Offers That Sell course yet… and I’m genuinely curious—why?

Here’s what I know: Most people don’t regret investing in their business. They regret waiting too long.

And the truth?
​
If you’re struggling to land clients or sell your offer consistently, that problem won’t magically fix itself.

You need a system that works—one that helps you:

    Get clarity on what your audience is desperate to buy
    Package it into an offer so good, they feel silly saying no
    Sell without complex funnels, endless sales calls, or second-guessing every move

That’s exactly what I help people do inside Banger Offers That Sell course.

#8 Subject: are you tired of being the best-kept secret?

It’s not the smartest.
Not the most talented.
Not even the most experienced.

The ones who scale to 6 and 7 figures?

They’re the ones positioned as the most trusted expert…

The authority.

I used to think getting clients online was about being better.

Sharpen your skills. Serve your clients. Stack your receipts.

Keep showing up and eventually, people will notice… right?

That was my approach.

Do great work. Stay humble. Let the results speak.

But they didn’t.

Because the market doesn’t reward the most talented. It rewards the most visible and positioned.

That realization changed everything.

I stopped relying on hope and started being intentional about how I showed up.

I revived a dead email list, trimmed it from 7,500 down to 2,400, and made $130K in 8 months just by showing up consistently and positioning myself as the go-to.

I wasn’t doing anything wrong.

I just hadn’t been intentional about how I was seen.

And in this game, if you’re not positioned with clarity, you’re easily overlooked… no matter how good you are.

Because I hadn’t claimed my space in the market. I hadn’t declared, “This is what I do. This is who I do it for. And this is why I’m the best one to do it for this specific audience.”

Once I made that shift, everything changed.

Suddenly I wasn’t just one of the good ones. I started positioning myself as THE authority… the ONLY logical choice to help my perfect audience solve their problems.

This is the real differentiator in today’s economy.

The best offers don’t always win. The best positioned ones do.

Because clients don’t buy based on skill. They buy based on belief. And belief is built through perception, clarity, and trust.

So the question becomes:

Do you want to be the authority, or keep wondering why people with less experience are winning?

There is no benefit to being the 17th best ___ (fill in the blank) in your market.

That spot gets paid in likes, not clients.

The ones who win?

They solve a clear problem for a specific person.

And they control how they’re positioned in the minds of the people they want to serve.

It’s not about chasing more attention. It’s about creating more alignment. And when the market sees you clearly, everything gets easier.

I’m dropping something NEW soon…

It’s for experts, course creators, and coaches who are done being overlooked.

For those who are tired of chasing clients, content, and clarity.

And ready to build the kind of brand that makes people lean in and say, “That’s who I’ve been looking for.”

If you know you’re meant to lead in your space…

Keep an eye out.

Your homie,
Alejandro Reyes

P.S. Honest question: Are you tired of being the best-kept secret?

Asking for a little vulnerability from ya.

I’ll be the first to admit that I was. It wasn’t for ego sake… I just knew I had something to share with the world and if the right people heard it, it would make an impact in their lives.

And with the clients we serve in The Arena Mastermind… it turns out I was right.

#9 Subject: 40k… from a Google Doc?

I’m thinking about putting together a small group to help entrepreneurs finally hit consistent $10k months... without funnels, daily content, or endless sales calls.

In 30 days, I’ll show you how to package your expertise into a leveraged $500–$10k offer…

And go from best-kept secret to the go-to authority in your market, so you can effortlessly land your first (or next) few clients using a simple, lean system that just works.

So far, I’ve helped folks like:

Nolan — YouTuber: Went from unemployed to launching his first offer and collecting $102k in just 74 days.
Jeremy — Coach for Pastors: Closed 257 clients for his $2,500 program using this exact system.
Justin — Digital Missionary: Invested $756 into ads and brought in $75,456 in sales… plus closed a $45,000 podcast sponsorship.
Alejandro (me) — Hit $40.6k in my first month, going all-in on this business, using this very system

This won’t be free.

But for the right person, it’s paid for itself many times over... often in just 30 to 60 days.

So if I put this together…

Would you be interested in learning more?

If you’re nodding your head, reply with the word 'AUTHORITY' to this email, and I’ll send you a quick Loom video about this new case study group.

#9 Subject: The $130K Google Doc (that makes Tariffs irrelevant)



"I just sold my first $6K client using nothing but a Google Doc."

That's the text I got from a workshop attendee just 24 hours after he created what I call a "Money Doc."

No funnel. No sales page. No automated sequence.

Just a simple document that did all the selling for him.

Last year, when I decided I was going to shut down my agency at the end of 2024, I had a dilemma. I wanted to go all-in on my mentoring and coaching business, but I didn't have time to build the "perfect" sales system everyone said I needed.

I went back to what had been quietly working for me and for my clients for years:

A simple Google Doc.
A few pages. Clear offer. No fluff. No funnel.

Nothing fancy... just clarity on a page.

Then, I ran some simple promos... by year's end, that single document had generated $130K in revenue (while running a full-time agency)

Not to mention that the same Google Doc formula made me $40K in February alone.

It just works.

I love this Peter Drucker quote? "The aim of marketing is to make selling superfluous."

Here's your boy Alejandro's version: The aim of marketing (for me, it's a simple newsletter and $5 a day ads) is to make funnels and sales calls superfluous (unnecessary).

When your positioning is right and your offer is clear, you don't need complicated selling systems. The marketing itself does the heavy lifting.

Your newsletter, your content, your conversations... they're all pre-selling for you. But only if you have a clear mechanism to capture that interest when it peaks.

That's what a Money Doc does. It's the bridge between interest and action.

After teaching this method to hundreds of others... like Nolan Molt (YouTube him), who's approaching his first year in business working with me and on track to hit $300K this month, I've realized something powerful:

Sales don't come from complexity. They come from clarity.

When someone can quickly understand exactly what you offer, who it's for, and why it works... without wading through fancy pages or high-pressure tactics... they're much more likely to buy.

It's counterintuitive in today's funnel-obsessed world, but sometimes the simplest approach is the most effective.

I've been focusing on newsletters and email growth strategies in these emails lately because they're foundational. But they're only half the equation.

The other half is having something simple and effective to sell.

I'm putting together a small workshop on Tuesday, April 22nd, where I'll walk through exactly how to create a Google Doc that sells courses and premium programs like hotcakes.

It's called the Money Docs Workshop.

I'm not opening registration quite yet, but if you're curious and want to be notified when the special $5 pre-sale goes live, just send me a quick email at alejandro@alejandroreyes.com with "WAITLIST" in the subject line.

Important: You don't get on the waitlist if you reply to this email. You gotta email me.

Love you and believe in you.

Your homie,
Alejandro Reyes

P.S. I've found that the people who get the most from these workshops are the ones who already have something to sell but are tired of complex funnels and high-pressure tactics. If that's you, I think you'll find this approach refreshingly effective.

#10 Subject: NEW workshop: Tarrif-Proof Your Business

Yo yo yo fam!

(quick note: this is your 24-hour notice)

Ever look at your calendar and realize you’re in a toxic relationship with Zoom?

Several years ago, my wife needed emergency surgery on the exact day I was supposed to launch a new program.

Great timing, right?

I had two choices: miss crucial sales calls (and income we really needed) OR be a crappy husband who prioritizes business over being there when his wife needed him most.

But what if there was a third option?

That day, instead of choosing between my wife and my business, I sent out a simple Google Doc, wrote a couple emails, and generated $52,872 that week… all from the hospital waiting room.

No sales calls. No fancy funnels. No daily content hamster wheel.

Just a strategic document that did all the selling for me.

Here’s what most coaches don’t realize:
Sales calls don’t scale.

They steal your freedom, drain your energy, and keep you trapped in your business instead of running it.

True leverage isn’t about working harder... it’s about creating systems that sell while you sleep.

A well-crafted Money Doc (as I call them) gives you that leverage, turning your expertise into a 24/7 sales machine that doesn’t require your presence on a call.

That’s exactly what I’m teaching in my NEW Money Doc Workshop on April 29th.

For just $5 (yes, seriously), you’ll get:

    The complete 3-day Money Doc Workshop, where I’ll walk you through my entire system step-by-step
    My fill-in-the-blank Money Doc Template that’s generated $100K+ (just copy, customize, and send)
    The AI prompt library I use to create compelling offers in minutes
    Real-world examples of Money Docs that have brought in $5K, $10K, even $30K in a single send
    A proven DM script that gets prospects to sell themselves (without you sounding desperate)

This isn’t just another workshop... it’s the difference between being chained to your calendar and finally having the freedom-based business you started this journey for.

But here’s the deal... this $5 price is ONLY for the first 100 people.

The normal price of the workshop is $100.

The email with the link goes out tomorrow at 8am PST sharp, and there’s already a waitlist of almost 100 people.

Want to make sure you don’t miss it?

Reply with “WAITLIST” and I’ll personally make sure you get the email BEFORE it goes public.

Your homie,
Alejandro "Money Docs" Reyes

P.S. My client Nolan went from FIRED to banking $102k in 74 days with this exact system.

Another client made $6k in 24 hours after he went my last Money Doc Workshop.

Hit reply with “WAITLIST” and I’ll make sure you’re first in line tomorrow.

#12 Subject: try this instead of praying someone buys

You ever launch something and pray someone buys?

Refresh the Stripe page.

Check your phone every 4 minutes like it’s gonna vibrate with purpose.

Yeah... that ain’t it no more.

You know what's sexier than a funnel?

Pre-sold, ready-to-buy prospects that want to buy your high-ticket programs without the need to talk to you on the phone.

Building a launch WAITLIST is a powerful way to do this in your business.

Not some fake “join the waitlist” button with a countdown timer that resets when you reload the page...

I’m talking about a real, low-friction DM/email convo where you say:

“I’m thinking about helping people [insert outcome here]. Want in if I do it?”

Simple.

I did that this week for a $5 workshop. No sales page.
Just a Google Doc and a waitlist.

Yesterday it opened.
Today... 7 seats left for $5.
​(and the price may have gone up by the time you read this)

That’s not a flex.
(Okay maybe it is a little...)

But it’s also a strategy you should be using if you're tired of guessing what your audience wants.

Because the second someone joins a waitlist?
They’ve mentally pre-bought.

They’ve said, “I want this. Let me know when I can give you money.”

How different would your launches or promos feel if you knew you had 50 people waiting in line like the old Apple launches?

No funnel. No calls. No scripts.
Just confidence... and conversions.

So now I’ll practice what I preach:

There are 7 spots left at $5 for Money Docs Workshop.

If you want to learn how to:

    Write a 1-page doc that closes $500–$30k clients
    Sell without calls, funnels, or daily posting
    Create leverage with clarity instead of tech...

This is your last shot before the price jumps.

​>>> Secure your spot to the Money Doc Workshop​

No pressure.

But also, if you're still building funnels and hoping for prospects to reach out to you...

You might wanna try selling with G-Doc's a college try.

Your homie,
Alejandro Reyes

P.S. I repeat... you know what's sexier than a funnel?

Pre-sold ready-to-buy prospects that want to buy your high-ticket programs without the need to talk to you on the phone.

#13 Subject: student makes 15k while on vacation

My client, Justin, was moving recently.

He wanted to pull in some quick cash before the chaos hit, so we jumped on a call to talk strategy.

His mind went to what most people do in that situation:

Run new ads. Launch a new offer. Try another channel. Do more.

I told him that’s fine, but it’s step two.

Step one?

Gold under your feet.

He already had an audience. He already had an offer.
He just hadn’t promoted it long enough or loud enough.

So we created a 10-email campaign.
Scheduled the whole thing before he went on vacation.

Three days in, he texted me.

Only one sale. I could hear the doubt in his message.

He was ready to hit the brakes.

But I told him what I’m telling you now:

Don't step just because it hasn't worked yet.

Because just showing up once or twice isn’t a campaign... It’s a tap.

You’ve got to push. Keep your foot down. Let it rip.

So he did. He stayed the course. Let the emails run.

Then he texted me when the campaign was just about over.

$10k in sales. Then another $5k trickled in over the next few days.

$15k on vacation because he didn’t flinch when the early results looked slow.

That’s what a campaign does.

And that’s what I’m doing right now with the Money Docs Workshop.​

Sold out 100 spots at $5. That could’ve been it.

But I didn’t let up.

I'm still talking about it.

I raised the price to $27, and another 34 people have joined.

I think Justin would have gladly paid $27 to learn how to put together and offer doc (I call them Money Docs)

Because this is what I teach, and this is what I do.

A little Inception for you...

You’re reading the lesson and watching the strategy play out in real time.

The goal of this workshop is to help you write one Google Doc that sells your $500 to $30k offer over and over and over again.

I’ve seen this doc turn into $15k, $50k, $100k+ campaigns.

​>>> Get in now for $27 before the price jumps on Thursday. ​

Let it rip,
Alejandro "All Gas, No Brakes" Reyes

P.S. Most people quit too early. Justin didn’t, and he made $15k.

The Money Doc Workshop shows you how to create the kind of asset that keeps working… even when you're not.
